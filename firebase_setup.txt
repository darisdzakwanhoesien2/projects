=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

? Please select an option: Use an existing project
? Select a default Firebase project for this directory: project-70f8e (Project)
i  Using project project-70f8e (Project)

=== Hosting Setup

Your public directory is the folder (relative to your project directory) that
will contain Hosting assets to be uploaded with firebase deploy. If you
have a build process for your assets, use your build's output directory.

? What do you want to use as your public directory? public
? Configure as a single-page app (rewrite all urls to /index.html)? Yes
? Set up automatic builds and deploys with GitHub? Yes
? File public/index.html already exists. Overwrite? Yes
✔  Wrote public/index.html

i  Detected a .git folder at /Users/darisdzakwanhoesien/Documents/Birru Central Code/New Final Code/nlp_pear_database/NUS-Oulu Courses/Projects/test
i  Authorizing with GitHub to upload your service account to a GitHub repository's secrets store.

Waiting for authentication...

✔  Success! Logged into GitHub as darisdzakwanhoesien2

? For which GitHub repository would you like to set up a GitHub workflow? (format: user/repository) 
darisdzakwanhoesien2/projects

✔  Created service account github-action-880989648 with Firebase Hosting admin permissions.
✔  Uploaded service account JSON to GitHub as secret FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PROJECT_70F8E.
i  You can manage your secrets at https://github.com/darisdzakwanhoesien2/projects/settings/secrets.

? Set up the workflow to run a build script before every deploy? Yes
? What script should be run before every deploy? npm ci && npm run build

✔  Created workflow file /Users/darisdzakwanhoesien/Documents/Birru Central Code/New Final Code/nlp_pear_database/NUS-Oulu Courses/Projects/test/.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml
? Set up automatic deployment to your site's live channel when a PR is merged? Yes
? What is the name of the GitHub branch associated with your site's live channel? main

✔  Created workflow file /Users/darisdzakwanhoesien/Documents/Birru Central Code/New Final Code/nlp_pear_database/NUS-Oulu Courses/Projects/test/.github/workflows/firebase-hosting-merge.yml

i  Action required: Visit this URL to revoke authorization for the Firebase CLI GitHub OAuth App:
https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/89cf50f02ac6aaed3484
i  Action required: Push any new workflow file(s) to your repo

i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...
i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...
i  Writing gitignore file to .gitignore...

✔  Firebase initialization complete!

You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /Users/darisdzakwanhoesien/Documents/Birru Central Code/New Final Code/nlp_pear_database/NUS-Oulu Courses/Projects/test

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory


=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  Using project project-70f8e (Project)

=== Functions Setup
Let's create a new codebase for your functions.
A directory corresponding to the codebase will be created in your project
with sample code pre-configured.

See https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/organize-functions for
more information on organizing your functions using codebases.

Functions can be deployed with firebase deploy.

? What language would you like to use to write Cloud Functions? JavaScript
? Do you want to use ESLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style? Yes
✔  Wrote functions/package.json
✔  Wrote functions/.eslintrc.js
✔  Wrote functions/index.js
✔  Wrote functions/.gitignore
? Do you want to install dependencies with npm now? Yes
