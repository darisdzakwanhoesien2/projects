It's an honor to have you both here tonight. Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. Donald Trump left us the worst public health epidemic in a century. You will see during the course of his rallies, he talks about fictional characters like Hannibal Lecter. He will talk about windmills cause cancer. And what you will also notice is that people start leaving his rallies early, out of exhaustion and boredom. People don't go to her rallies, there's no reason to go. And the people that do go, she's bussing them in and paying them to be there. She has a plan to confiscate everybody's gun. President Trump, we do have to move. Tim Walz and I are both gun owners. We're not taking anybody's guns away. So stop with the continuous lying about this stuff. I don't know, I mean, all I can say is I read where she was not black, that she put out. And I'll say that. And then I read that she was black. I mean, honestly, I think it's a tragedy that we have someone who wants to be president, who has consistently, over the course of his career, attempted to use race to divide the American people. In Springfield, they're eating the dogs, the people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there. You talk about extreme. There is no state in this country where it is legal to kill a baby after it's born. Madam Vice President, I want to get your response to President Trump. One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree. The government, and Donald Trump certainly, should not be telling a woman what to do with her body. I have talked with women around our country. You want to talk about this is what people wanted? She hates Israel. She wouldn't even meet with Netanyahu when he went to Congress to make a very important speech. But just so you understand, they sent her to negotiate peace before this war started. Three days later, he went in, and he started the war. Yet again, I said it at the beginning of this debate. You're going to hear a bunch of lies coming from this fellow. And that is another one. When I went to meet with President Zelensky, I've now met with him over five times, the reality is it has been about standing as America always should. If Donald Trump were president, Putin would be sitting in Kiev right now. So I think you've heard tonight two very different visions for our country, one that is focused on the future and the other that is focused on the past. She's been there for 3 1⁄2 years. They've had 3 1⁄2 years to fix the border. They've had 3 1⁄2 years to create jobs and all the things we talked about. Why hasn't she done it?"
