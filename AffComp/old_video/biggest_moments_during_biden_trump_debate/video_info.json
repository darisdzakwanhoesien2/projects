    "description": "In the 90-minute debate, the economy and abortion rights were top topics.\n\n---\n\nPresident Joe Biden and his Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, meet for the first debate of the 2024 election in Atlanta, Georgia, a state expected to play a pivotal role in November after it tipped the scales in Biden's favor in 2020.\n\nThursday night, Biden, the Democratic incumbent, gets the chance to reassure voters that, at 81, he’s capable of guiding the U.S. through a range of challenges. The 78-year-old Trump, meanwhile, could use the moment to try to move past his felony conviction in New York and convince an audience of tens of millions that he’s temperamentally suited to return to the Oval Office.\n\nThe debate is being hosted by CNN.\n\nLive updates from the night: https://www.11alive.com/article/news/politics/biden-trump-presidential-debate-atlanta-live-updates/85-cf1f7f2e-a4e0-4ca0-b95e-53634bdaa9db\n\nVERIFYING claims from the presidential debate between Trump and Biden: https://www.11alive.com/article/news/verify/elections-verify/verifying-claims-from-presidential-debate-between-trump-and-biden/536-ac0b7295-eb40-4831-b964-fdb5a65db9d7\n\n---\n\n11Alive believes that news shouldn’t be a one-way conversation, but a dialogue with you.
