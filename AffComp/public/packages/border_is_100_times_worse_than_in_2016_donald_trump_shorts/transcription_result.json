I fixed the border originally. That's how I got elected in a way. But now the border is—and I fixed it, and I couldn't even use it in 2020. In 2016, it was a big factor of my win. I fixed it very quickly, and then in 2020 it was so good. I said, let me talk about the border. My people over here, all these geniuses said, police here, don't talk about the border. It's fixed. I said, let's talk about it. But nobody wanted to hear about it. But now the border is a hundred times worse than it was in 2016. Former President Trump slamming President Biden's handling of the border as he outlines what he would do to fix it.",
