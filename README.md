You can download the code into ZIP Files and install necessary library. Please note that it's necessary to install ffmpeg, and currently it's working on MacOS only
1. Install necessary Python Module: pip3 install yt-dlp pydub openai pandas numpy nltk matplotlib seaborn requests tqdm (or use pip)
2. For conda environment setup, add Javascript installation: conda install -c conda-forge nodejs
3. Install necessary Javascript modules: npm install express fs path ejs
4. To test the sentiment analysis, simply put in the terminal python3 python_conda_test.py (you are welcome to change the URL variable for the new video), you also need the OpenAI API 
5. Once the Javascript module are installed, you can execute it by
node app.js to see all the visualization


This Javascript command installs the following modules:
1. express: The express module is a popular Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications.
2. fs: The fs (File System) module enables interaction with the file system in Node.js, allowing you to manipulate files and directories.
3. path: The path module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths in a way that is cross-platform compatible.
4. ejs: Similar to HTML, it use to visualize dynamics datasets

This Python command installs the following modules:
1. yt-dlp: for downloading videos.
2. pydub: for audio manipulation.
3. openai: for interacting with the OpenAI API.
4. pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.
5. numpy: for numerical computations.
6. nltk: for natural language processing.
7. matplotlib: for plotting data.
8. seaborn: for statistical data visualization.
9. requests: for making HTTP requests.
10. tqdm: for progress bars.
