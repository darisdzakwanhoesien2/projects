    "transcription_text": "We're coming on the air right now because we have just learned that Kamala Harris, the current vice president, has called now-president-elect Donald Trump in a concession speech. And we understand she will be making remarks to the nation at 4 p.m. We want to bring in senior White House correspondent Kelly O'Donnell. Now, Kelly, what have you learned about what was discussed on that phone call? Well, advisors to the vice president say that she placed the call to Donald Trump, the now-president-elect, and wanted to talk about the need for a peaceful transition and being a president for all Americans. A concession call used to be commonplace. It used to be an absolute basic of election life in America. And that changed when Donald Trump did not concede in 2020. And so part of what we're seeing from the Biden-Harris administration, already from President Biden and certainly from Kamala Harris, who, of course, is feeling, you know, I'm sure, disappointment and distress over losing, trying to get back to those institutions. So they are going to have the conversation. She will make remarks to the public later this afternoon.",
