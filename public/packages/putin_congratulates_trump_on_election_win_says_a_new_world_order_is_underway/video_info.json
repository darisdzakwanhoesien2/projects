    "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said he congratulated Donald Trump on winning the U.S. presidential election and said he was ready to speak to him as any ideas on facilitating an end to the Ukraine crisis merited attention.\n \nPutin also condemned the U.S. for seeking to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia in Ukraine and said a struggle was underway to shape a \"new world order\" as the Western-dominated post-Cold War era crumbled.\n \n\"We have come to a dangerous line,\" Putin told the Valdai discussion club in the Black Sea resort of Sochi, a day after learning that Donald Trump had won the U.S. presidential election.\n \n\"The calls of the West to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia, a country with the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons, demonstrates the exorbitant adventurism of Western politicians,\" said Putin.\n\nFor more info, please go to https://globalnews.ca/news/10856487/donald-trump-ukraine-support/\n\nSubscribe to Global News Channel HERE: http://bit.ly/20fcXDc\nLike Global News on Facebook HERE: http://bit.ly/255GMJQ\nFollow Global News on X HERE: http://bit.ly/1Toz8mt\nFollow Global News on Instagram HERE: https://bit.ly/2QZaZIB\n#GlobalNews #putin #trump",
